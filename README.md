## Technologies

This project was built with `Python` and `Typer`, a library for creating command-line interfaces (CLI). For text-to-speech functionality, it uses the [`Kokoro-82M`](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) AI model. To search for words, it utilizes the [`Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary API`](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-learners-dictionary). The Anki decks are generated using the [`genakin`](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For run this project, you will need the following things:

- [`Python 3.12.9`](https://www.python.org/)
- [`Merriam Webster API Key`](https://dictionaryapi.com/)

You need to create `.env` file into the project folder with the following keys: `MERRIAM_WEBSTER_DICTIONARY_API`

### Installation
After fill all the [`prerequisites`](#prerequisites) you can create a `.venv` folder for local installation of the required packages.

For install the `required` packages for the project you need to run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to install in your machine for use any time, you need to run this command in the project folder:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Usage

If you only want to run the project directly in the folder you can run the following command for see all the commands:

```bash
python -m anki_deck_generator --help
```

or if you install in your machine run this command:

```bash
anki_deck --help
```

## Backlog
 - [x] Create a place to store words that have already been added to avoid extra work (a CSV with word, status headers).
 - [ ] Use an offline dictionary to improve performance.
 - [ ] Allow adding cards to existing decks (currently, a new deck must be created).
 - [ ] Use default values for IPA, meaning, and example if they are not found in the dictionary.
 - [ ] Add a Rich progress bar to display what is happening behind the scenes.

## Motivation
In 2025, I set a goal to improve my English to secure a job earning in dollars, euros, or any other currency stronger than the Brazilian real. To achieve this, I started a routine of studying for 2 hours every day, divided as follows:

- Reading: 30 minutes.
- Listening: 30 minutes.
- Grammar: 30 minutes.
- Conversation: 30 minutes.

My idea was to take words I didn't know during reading and listening and add them to my Anki deck for later study. However, this process became problematic. To add a new card, I had to look up the word in a dictionary, get the meaning and an example, generate text-to-speech for each, and then transfer everything to Anki in the correct fields.

Basically, it took me 5 minutes to add a new word. So, the best solution was to automate this process.

That's how I decided to create this CLI to automate the creation of my flashcards.
